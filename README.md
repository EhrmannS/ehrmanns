### Welcome

On this github profile you'll find 

- software I develop and maintain (such as [R::geometr](https://github.com/EhrmannS/geometr) and [R::tabshiftr](https://github.com/luckinet/tabshiftr))
- scripts that document the analyses of my research projects

I do also have an [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2958-0796
) profile and my [personal blog](https://ehrmanns.github.io/blog/), where I contemplate mostly about interoperability in general, but also the scientific fields I participate in.
